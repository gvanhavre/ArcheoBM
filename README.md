Archaeology Based Modelling: A few NetLogo models for archaeology classes.

### What is it?
Archaeology-Based Models are made for students and people interested in archaeology. It proposes to study basic field methods and phenomena to illustrate how they impact on an excavation process.

### Rock Art Landscape
This model analyse how the balance between nature and culture affects the landscape, using rock art sites as a proxy. The user can choose between a world where the decision to make a new painting is defined by general environmental characteristics, and a world where it is defined by purely cultural criteria - individual to each turtle. Does it change the way rock art sites are created in the landscape? How does that correlates with the archaeological context that can be studied in specific regions? How does a cumulative effect affects the results?

This model's successive versions have been presented at the 2016 Brazilian Rock Art Association and at the 2017 Computer Application in Archaeology.

### Sampling
New version. In v0.3 one can play it alone and use it to compare how field methods affect the excavation process. Here, the archaeologist can design his own field methodology, and see how it would random and systematic sampling have worked out. The model uses a system of point-and-click to produce actions.

New things from version 0.5:
- The point-and-click step are simplified. Just hit the Go excavate! button and click wherever you want. It allows to click-and-drag to create trenches and shapes.
- Added the amount or proportion of sites/concentrations found by the archaeologist and through other methods.
- Revealing the map now shows all three methods in different colors.
