Archaeology Based Modelling: A few NetLogo models for archaeology classes.

### What is it?
Archaeology-Based Models are made for students and people interested in archaeology. It proposes to study basic field methods and phenomena to illustrate how they impact on an excavation process.

### Sampling
This model allows the user to experience sampling problems and strategies with two different methods: systematic and random. In this version, the user can individually populate and scatter achaeological remains in an empty landscape, choose a method and begin the prospection by digging and extending the quads. A number of statistics show how efficient the chosen method is. 

Things to do:
- Better scattering, maybe randomly;
- Automatize the process

### Rock Art Landscape
This model abalyse how the balance between nature and culture affects the landscape, using rock art sites as a proxy. The user can choose between a world where the decision to make a new painting is defined by general environmental characteristics, and a world where it is defined by purely cultural criteria - individual to each turtle. Does it change the way rock art sites are created in the landscape? How does that correlates with the archaeological context that can be studied in specific regions? How does a cumulative effect affects the results?

This model's successive versions have been presented at the 2016 Brazilian Rock Art Association and at the 2017 Computer Application in Archaeology.
