Archaeology Based Modeling: A few NetLogo models for archaeology classes.

### Sampling_V1.nlogo
This model allows the user to experience sampling problems and strategies with different methods: user-defined, random and systematic. In v1, it works as a point-and-click or point-and-drag game. The model is written for archaeology students to understand how sampling design has a impact on the results of an excavation.
