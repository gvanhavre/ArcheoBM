# ArcheoBM
Archaeology Based Modelling: A few NetLogo models for archaeology classes.

### Sampling_V0.1.nlogo
This model allows the user to experience sampling problems and strategies with two different methods: systematic and random. In v0.1, two different approaches are available. In the first one, the user can individually populate and scatter the underground remains, choose a method and expand the digging correspondingly. In the second one, the user selects the amount of sites and the size of the grid with sliders. He's then able to produce a 100x statistical test to see which method is more efficient.

Things to do:
- Better scattering, maybe randomly;
- More general statistics to compare both methods;
- Some way to measure how extending works (threshold 50% of the total remains?);
-
